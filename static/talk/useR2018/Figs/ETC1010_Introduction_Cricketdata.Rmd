#MOTIVATION

Accessibility

-  Not relying on my fellow software engineers for my data

-  Having more time for visualization and modelling my data rather than on data fetching and manipulation

Reproducibility

-  An world where code, technical details, and data analysis are all in one place and under my control

---

```{r Funny,echo=FALSE, fig.out="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('Figs/Funny.gif')
```



---

####Structure of [ESPNcricinfo](http://www.espncricinfo.com/) - One of the few sophisticated takes on international cricket performance

- _**StatsGuru**_ a database of historical matches and players from the 18th century to the present

class: left,left

###Collectively, all this data has the potential to create vast opportunities in statistical thinking in cricket


<span style="color:green"> User needs to insert **FIVE** (approx) queries on the website to obtain information about performance of **ONE** player  </span>

<span style="color:brown">Limited ways to save those tables efficiently for **comprehensive comparison** of two or more players </span>

class: center,middle

# <span style="color:MediumVioletRed"> Package CricketData </span>

##Opening door to more data driven stories for men's and women's cricket

---
# Package - [CricketData](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/cricketdata)

Contains scraper functions for downloading data from ESPNCricinfo into tibbles which can be readily used to analyse the performance of players across different game formats and activities


<span style="color:MediumVioletRed">**fetch_cricinfo** </span>    
To fetch Innings/Career summaries of the players for all countries  


<span style="color:MediumVioletRed">**find_player_id**</span>  
To fetch player id when the user types the name (may be partial) of the player  

<span style="color:MediumVioletRed">**fetch_player_data**</span>  
To obtain the performance of a player in different formats like TESTS, ODI or T20 and different activities like batting, fielding and bowling using the player id obtained from *find_player_id*

### Which women players have scored consecutive centuries in ODI ?

```{r Conc1002,echo=TRUE,size="small"}
library("cricketdata")
WBI <- fetch_cricinfo("odi", "Women", "Batting", type="innings")
WBI %>% arrange(Player, Date, Runs) %>%
  mutate(NC = Runs >= 100,
         RL = rep(rle(NC)$lengths, rle(NC)$lengths),
         RV = rep(rle(NC)$values, rle(NC)$lengths)) %>% 
  filter(NC == TRUE) %>%
  group_by(Player, Country) %>%
  summarize(Con_cent = max(RL)) %>%
  filter(Con_cent >= 2) %>%
  select(Player, Country) %>%
  knitr::kable() %>% kable_styling(font_size = 12)

## Does Indian fielders take more wickets than non-fielders?


```{r WK_dismissals,echo=TRUE,size="small",out.width="100%",out.height="100%",fig.width=14,fig.height=11}
