abstract: Package `gghdr` provides the framework to visualize Highest Density Regions (HDR) with the grammar of graphics as implemented in `ggplot2`. There are several statistical methods (viz. box plots, summary plots or letter value plots) to summarize a distribution by region of the sample space covering certain probability. The method of summarizing a distribution using HDR are useful for plotting multimodal distributions. HDR may include disjoint subsets each covering a local mode.
