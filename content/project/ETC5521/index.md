Synopsis: Before modelling and predicting, data should first be explored to uncover the patterns and structures that exist. Exploratory data analysis involves both numerical and visual techniques designed to reveal interesting information that may be hidden in the data. However, an analyst must be cautious not to over-interpret apparent patterns, and to properly assess the results of a data exploration.

This course is taught by [Professor Dianne Cook
](http://dicook.org/) and [Dr. Emi Tanaka](https://emitanaka.org/).

Taught as teaching assistant in Semester 2, 2020.
