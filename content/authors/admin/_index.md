Hello, folks! Welcome to my home page. I am doing PhD at the [Econometrics and Business Statistics Department](https://www.monash.edu/business/econometrics-and-business-statistics/) of [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/) under the supervision of [Rob J Hyndman](https://robjhyndman.com/) and [Di Cook](http://www.dicook.org/). My dissertation focuses on building visualization and statistical tools for analyzing spatially distributed big time series data.

I'm passionate about putting to use statistics to solve real world problems and I almost always use R to do that.

Apart from my research, I spend my time learning Indian classical music, travelling in and around Melbourne and exploring cafes near me.

_Be kind, remember you are collaborating with your future self_
